<h3>Who are we? </h3>  

Were **four friends** who decided to start a small project for the **older generations**. :)
Our goal is to create an app that **helps them** better understand the ever-evolving world of modern **technology**.

Since its often challenging for *some* older people to adapt to new tech, we want to make the transition **easier**.
Our app will serve as a **tutorial** or **guide** with a fun, game-like touch. It will be **simple** to use, yet capable of **explaining** even complex topics in a clear way.
